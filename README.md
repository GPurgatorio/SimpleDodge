# SimpleDodge

Simple arcade Dodge Game to play when you're bored. 
I find it kinda addictive, even though I implemented this while I didn't know what to do 'cause I was tired after lesson.

Maybe I'll code more stuff from time to time if I feel like something cool could be added
My record at the moment sits at 26780, beat me (without the use of console ty) ;D
